Data Analysis of Retail Sales - [SQL] [Tableau] [Excel] [Weka ML]

```The Purpose of this analysis will be to analyze sales, products, customers and more, in order to potentially understand what products sell best where, identify unusual behaviors that might lead fraud investigations, forecast demand, create a promotional strategy.```



Understanding the Data
-
- InvoiceNo:	A 6-digit number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If the number is prefixed with 'c', it indicates a cancellation. (Nominal)
- StockCode:	A unique identifier for each product sold by the retailer. (Nominal)
- Description:	The name or a brief description of the product. (Nominal)
- Quantity:	The number of units of the product sold in each transaction. (Numeric)
- InvoiceDate:	The date and time when the transaction was made. (Datetime)
- UnitPrice: The price per unit of the product in sterling. (Numeric)
- Country:	The country where the customer resides. (Nominal)

Data Prep/Cleaning
-
- New Attributes
  - 'InvoiceNo' contains letter "C" indicating a canceled invoice. Created a new column 'IsCanc' that denominates a canceled order by using a nested IF function, searching for value = "C", if true, the output will be yes.
  - ```=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("C", B2)), "Yes", "No")```
- Attribute Conversion
  - Used Excel function to convert 'InvoiceNo' from Nominal to Numerical by utilizing '=RIGHT' to remove "C" letter since we created the new 'IsCanc' column.
  - ```=RIGHT(B2,6)```
  - Named new Numerical Column 'Invoice'
- Reformat
  - 'InvoiceDate' originally formatted = m/d/yyyy h:mm will not be read correctly when importing CVS into SQL. Reformat column into yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
- New Calculation
  - 'Total Price' multiplying 'Quantity' by 'Unit Price'

SQL Prep [*mysql*] & [*PopSQL*]
-
```All code found in Repo 'SQL' Folder```
- Create New Database 'rsaproject' from terminal
  - ```CREATE DATABASE RSAProject;```
- New Query and create table 'online_retail' to import data
